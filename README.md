GemVision is a lightweight Python tool that uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model to compare visual identity across media formats. It accepts both image and video inputs, analyzes their content, and determines if a person depicted in the image appears in the video â€” all via multimodal prompts powered by Google GenAI SDK.
